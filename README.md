Apologies for the mess

# Mod List
Most mods here are available on Modrinth<br>
You can probably just search the name listed here to find them<br>
If not, have a look at the toml file

Tools are more things that use physical items and blocks, utilities are more things that change game menus and such

## Server Only
Mods which are only present on the server, not intended for use on an integrated server<br>
Some of these would be nice to have on an integrated server, but are left out to reduce the client mod count<br>
Should still be kept at a minimum, singleplayer should be totally functional

- Create Track Map

#### Apparently a Quilt mod the entire time?

### Unwanted

- Sodium Extra
- https://modrinth.com/mod/expandingtechnologies

### Broken

- gravestones-v1.15


## Considering

### Removal
- Item Alchemy - kind of (super) unbalanced
- Command Aliases - replace with tpcommands
- Gamma Utils - kind of cheaty
- Quality Sounds - doesn't Repurposed Footsteps offer the same?
- Simple Discord Link - replace with BOC-Discord
- WTHIT - replace with Jade
- Entity Model Features
- Entity Texture Features
- Enhanced Block Entities

### Addition
- Proximity Voice Chat
- Sound Physics Remastered
- possibly more create addons
- BOC-Discord (then BOC-MsgClient)

- https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum-jetpacks
- https://modrinth.com/mod/music-maker-mod
- https://modrinth.com/mod/xercamod
- tpcommands
- things with more rail variants, think the copper rail
    - will need to create 3d rail models for these
- more reborn energy based tech
- https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage
- https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-copper-pipes
- https://modrinth.com/mod/chalk
- https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-cavity
    - plus creating a datapack for extra mod support
- https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat
- https://modrinth.com/mod/every-compat

# Packs
Datapacks, resourcepacks, whatever<br>
Datapacks should be available on both sides
## Datapacks
- Repurposed Structures - Friends and Foes Compat
- Oogacraft Datapack
    - some vanillatweaks packs
    - some origins
    - other custom stuff
        - custom recipes
        - tags
## Resourcepacks
- RAY's 3D Rails

# Other todo
- default keybindings
- set up almost unified
- set up duplicate blocks being replaced (unified)
    - https://modrinth.com/mod/block-swap ?
- figure out how to add vanilla tweaks packs to packwiz
    - am i allowed to redistribute?
- how do i ensure certain mod provided resource packs are enabled on new installs?
    - traditional approach was to have them enabled in the distributed options.txt...
- come up with a better recipe for the orb of origins
- command blocks need to be enabled for create structures to work
### Configs
- add configs
    - the following need extra thought:
    - wthit/jade defaults
    - emi defaults
    - default keybinds
    - xaeros' default settings
    - dimensional doors has a lot of interesting options

### Longer Term Configs
(stuff that either needs constantly updating, or i'm too lazy to do now)
- item alchemy emc
- enabling other modded crafting tables in visual workbench if any are added
- inventorysorter
    - watch out for inventories that need to be blacklisted
- fallingleaves
    - windless dimensions
- snow under trees supported biomes
- yung's better*
    - maybe add modded items to the loot and gear pools?
- simplehats drop chance
- fabric seasons
    - season length
    - biome denylist
    - basically everything
- amendments inverse potions
- emi
    - watch out for functions that should be disabled in emi loot
- artifacts rarities
    - possibly some renewable way to get them
    - mimics are disabled
    - perhaps with the tech and magic mods?
- space dimensions
    - mobs immune to space damage
- add overpowered things to item obliterator
- finish the oogacraft:dimdoors tag

### Stretch Goals
- a lot of mods could do with compat datapacks
- a lot of mods could also do with compat mods
    - e.g. space dimensions with reborn energy
- create a custom log config to reduce log spam
- adding estrogen models for all armor (very low priority)
- custom splashes could be cool?
- certain mods should really be using different tags
    - yes, this one is broad, it would be a lot of work
- mod compat recipes
    - adorn's brewer has a lot of potential
    - create addition's rolling
    - create should be able to make tech reborn plates
- download mods to more uniform filenames?
- reorganise oogacraft datapack to be less of a mess

## Current Issues
errors, broken mods, etc
- i do still want fsit
- identity crashes when trying to open its menu
- something seems to be breaking mipmaps for the block atlas?
- estrogen moth elytra item model is missing
- "Game took 144.804 seconds to start"
- broken patchouli books:
    - betternether
    - extra alchemy
- "Config file had missing entry item_quads_expansion"
- tons of mixin refmap errors
- "Unknown block '...' in 'matchBlocks' element '...' at index 4 in file 'minecraft:optifine/ctm/_overlays/....properties' in pack 'fabric'"
- "No texture minecraft:textures/missingno.png" funny
- clients often just get disconnected from the server when joining?


- missing sounds:
    - qualitysounds
    - supplementaries
    - unimportant but why does vanilla still log about the goat horn and goat horn breaking sound events not having sounds?
- missing textures:
    - create goggles
    - many biome item sprites
- bad textures:
    - create cooking (breaking mipmaps)
        - sausage2 500x500
        - sandwich 362x362
        - hamburger 707x767
    - agape_space:block/powered_lamp_attach 24x24
- bad blockstates:
    - missing variants:
        - dimdoors:limbo_air
        - itemalchemy:emc_cable
        - create's cart assembler needs adapting for 3d rails
- missing models:
    - a lot of elytra trims
        - i feel like this is a logic error in one of the mods

- bad recipes
    - spectrum has a few missing titration barrel recipes
    - "Your custom createaddition:... recipe specified a duration. Durations have no impact on this type of recipe."
    - a LOT of unknown recipe categories. is this vanilla or EMI?

- bad paths in resourcepacks:
    - item alchemy references some .java files
    - simplehats has a space in one of its filenames

- missing translations:
    - create broken bad has a lot
    - space dimensions is missing them for its biomes
    - dimensional doors' fluids
    - dimensional doors' enchant descriptions
    - lots of status effect descriptions
    - LOTS of tags

- various mods making all the trims warn about them not having layer0 textures
    - dynamic trim also seems mad about these
    - this could be harmless and just a result of them using 3d item models
    - if so just disable these log messages
    - might also need to disable trimming these armors?
- something is trying to use additional entity attributes
- a lot of model loaders are apparently not registered?
- invalid descriptors on some fastanim mixins?
- origins doesn't open its picker on new joins?
    - this leaves players invulnerable until they manually choose both an origin and a class
    - the orb of origins works fine though
