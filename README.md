Apologies for the mess

# Mod List
Most mods here are available on Modrinth<br>
You can probably just search the name listed here to find them<br>
If not, have a look at the toml file

Tools are more things that use physical items and blocks, utilities are more things that change game menus and such

## Server Only
Mods which are only present on the server, not intended for use on an integrated server<br>
Some of these would be nice to have on an integrated server, but are left out to reduce the client mod count<br>
Should still be kept at a minimum, singleplayer should be totally functional

- Command Aliases
    - > Only used to map `/trigger spawn` to `/spawn`
- Create Track Map
- LuckPerms
- Simple Discord Link
- Spark

## Removed

### Unused

- Fabric Sky Boxes Interop (fsb-interop-1.3.6+mc1.20.1-build.50.jar)
- Animatica
- OptiGUI

#### Apparently a Quilt mod the entire time?
- raesbetterfarming-1.0.1.jar

### Unwanted
- AdvancementInfo
    - Replaced by Paginated Advancements
- Bobby
    - Not worth it on lower end devices
- DashLoader
- Origins++
- Skin Layers 3D
    - Most people just seem to not like this

### Outdated
- CreateFabricREIBugFix-0.1.0-create0.5.1-mc1.20.x.jar.disabled
- Create Origins
- Sodium Extra

### Broken
All of these were broken when they were first added<br>
They might not be now, I don't think it's worth checking
- overworld_mirror-fabric-1.20.1-1.7.0.23.jar.disabled
- create_bitterballen-0.0.65+1.20.1.jar.disabled
- gravestones-v1.15


## Considering

### Removal
- Item Alchemy - kind of (super) unbalanced
- Command Aliases - replace with tpcommands
- Gamma Utils - kind of cheaty
- Quality Sounds - doesn't Repurposed Footsteps offer the same?
- Simple Discord Link - replace with BOC-Discord
- WTHIT - replace with Jade

### Addition
- Proximity Voice Chat
- Sound Physics Remastered
- possibly more create addons
- BOC-Discord (then BOC-MsgClient)
- Almost Unified
- Jade
- EMI integrations for resources and such
- Hephaestus (Tinkers' Construct)
- https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum-jetpacks
- https://modrinth.com/mod/music-maker-mod
- https://modrinth.com/mod/xercamod
- tpcommands
- things with more rail variants, think the copper rail
- more reborn energy based tech

# Other todo
- add configs
- add stuff to item obliterator
- set up almost unified
- set up duplicate blocks being replaced (unified)
- download mods to more uniform filenames?

## Current Issues
- i do still want fsit
- identity crashes when trying to open its menu
